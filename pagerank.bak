;; Assignment 1: Implementing PageRank
;;
;; PageRank is a popular graph algorithm used for information
;; retrieval and was first popularized as an algorithm powering
;; the Google search engine. Details of the PageRank algorithm will be
;; discussed in class. Here, you will implement several functions that
;; implement the PageRank algorithm in Racket.
;;
;; Hints: 
;; 
;; - For this assignment, you may assume that no graph will include
;; any "self-links" (pages that link to themselves) and that each page
;; will link to at least one other page.
;;
;; - you can use the code in `testing-facilities.rkt` to help generate
;; test input graphs for the project. The test suite was generated
;; using those functions.
;;
;; - You may want to define "helper functions" to break up complicated
;; function definitions.

;; This program accepts graphs as input. Graphs are represented as a
;; list of links, where each link is a list `(,src ,dst) that signals
;; page src links to page dst.

;; Our implementation takes input graphs and turns them into
;; PageRanks. A PageRank is a Racket hash-map that maps pages (each 
;; represented as a Racket symbol) to their corresponding weights,
;; where those weights must sum to 1 (over the whole map).
;; A PageRank encodes a discrete probability distribution over pages.
;;
;; The test graphs for this assignment adhere to several constraints:
;; + There are no "terminal" nodes. All nodes link to at least one
;; other node.
;; + There are no "self-edges," i.e., there will never be an edge `(n0
;; n0).
;; + To maintain consistenty with the last two facts, each graph will
;; have at least two nodes.
;; + There will be no "repeat" edges. I.e., if `(n0 n1) appears once
;; in the graph, it will not appear a second time.
;;
;; (-> any? boolean?)

;;
;; Where:
;;  + d is a specified "dampening factor." in range [0,1]; e.g., 0.85
;;  + N is the number of pages in the graph
;;  + S is the sum of P(page-j) for all page-j.
;;  + P(page-j) is CurrentPageRank(page-j)/NumLinks(page-j)
;;  + NumLinks(page-j) is the number of outbound links of page-j
;;  (i.e., the number of pages to which page-j has links).
